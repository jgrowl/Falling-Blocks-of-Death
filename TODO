== TODO List ==

= Sprint 1 =

[x] 0. Add basic vector and matrix support
[ ] 1. Add audio functions; music, sound effects
[ ] 2. Create grid for tetris block locations; Add supporting functions for manipulating grid
[ ] 3. Create model for tetris shapes; Create all tetris shapes based on the "object" model
[ ] 4. Create doc for gameplay; define possible inputs (up, down, left, right) and their actions in the game, define conditions for advancing to the next level and the difference between levels, define losing conditions, etc.
[ ] 5. Add very basic block drawing capability; Draw( vec2_t pos ) should just draw a block at the 'pos' argument; this can be used for testing.


= Sprint 2 =
1. Add collision detection for tetris blocks
2. Add ability to detect when game is lost
3. Generalize draw() to take an array of triangles
